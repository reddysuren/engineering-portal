**What is API Testing?**
Application Programming Interface often called as **API**. An API is a set of methods, procedures that developers “open up” to other programmers in order to have their applications communicate and interact with other applications. Once an API is built, it is necessary to test the interface to provide truly secure, reliable and scalable connections between platforms.

API testing is helpful to identify early issues and is different from UI testing, An API receives requests and sends back responses through internet protocols including HTTP and SMTP. API tests investigates applications that have varying API functionalities and varies the parameters of the API calls in different ways that verify functionality and expose failures.

API testing can be done on below aspects:
 - Functional Testing
 - Load Testing
 - Security Testing
 
 **Functional Testing** checks the functionality of the API, Takes payload in the form of JSON or XML and provides the response code and response body.
 **Load Testing** checks the performance under the specific load and helps to determine how much traffic the API can handle before being overloaded.
 **Security Testing** checks vulnerabilities like type of authentication and sensitive date is encrypted over http and also includes penetration testing validating authentication.
 

 

**Advantages of API testing during Software development**

***1. Time efficiency***

API Testing doesn't required to be wait for GUI to be ready and it can be performed way early in developement Cycle. The Automated API tests provide much quicker test results and significantly accelerate development workflows, Thus it helps you speed up the feedback loop and catch issues faster.

In addition to that, API tests take very less time-consuming when campared to UI Tests. UI Tests spend much time to on rendering and loading the web pages and interface leements whereas API tests can be executed in seconds. Let take an example where an user need to register and login from UI takes at least 3 to 5 minitues, where as through API testing it takes less than 30 seconds.

***2. Reduced costs***

It is very closely connected with **time efficiency**.
The cost efficiency benefit is closely connected with the previous one. The increased execution speed of automated API tests leads to more effective/efficient resource consumption and lower overall testing costs.

API tests can be executed as early as the business logic is defined and prior to any GUI testing. So it will help you to indentify the issue at ealry stage, Early identification means the **less expensive** it is to fix it and **Reduces the cost of Application changes**. API testing enables the QA team to detect and resolve issues before they become a problem in production, keeping project costs at bay.

***3. Technology Independent***

API tests are Language Independent, Since the data is nterchanged using JSON or XML and compromised of HTTP requests and HTTPresponses. So QA team is free to choose the language of their choice that supports this technologies((JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, etc.).

***4. Greater tests stability***

While GUI's are dynamic and may change to accommodate new requests from stakeholders and users, API interfaces are very much stable. APIs typically come with detailed documentation, and any changes are reflected there so that QA engineers can adjust their test suites timely. And due to this inherent stability, API tests are also much easier to maintain. 

***5. Improved test coverage***

Unlike unit tests, automated API tests are generally broader in scope and detailed. While unit tests are focused on limited functionality of components within a single application, problems often arise at the intersection where the scope of one layer ends and the other begins.

You won’t be able to find these issues with unit tests, but API-level tests are specifically designed to verify that all system components function as intended. API testing helps uncover potential defects in the interfaces, servers, and databases, improving the overall software quality and contributing to better user experiences.

**Efficiency gains associated with an API testing tool can include:**

-   The number of test cycles a QA team can complete in a given timeframe will be increased.
-   The number and variety of tests performed in a given timeframe will be increased.
- The amount of time spent manually executing tests prior to UAT will be reduced.

**Conclusion:**
API testing is recognized as a better fit for Continuous Testing in Agile methodologies . If the API is not tested properly, it may cause issues not only at API application but also in the calling application. It is an indispensable test in software engineering.
